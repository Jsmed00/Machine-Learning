QUICKSTART

Jupyter Notebook is needed to run our code. Click the run button at the top to run the code provided.


Which K works the best:

There were a few K's that were lower than the others (96.8%) but once the K got above about 6 the accuracy seemed to be a
consistent 99.5%. We believed this is the case because there was no data sparsity. Because of this the machine didnt need to
go through all of the data and insert 0's as placeholders.
